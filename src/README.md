# Data Structures Week Implementation (Java)

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures in Java, as part of a one-week training program.

## Day 1: Implemented Structures

1. Dynamic Array  
   A resizable array that grows automatically when it reaches capacity.  
   File: arrays/DynamicArray.java  
   Includes basic operations like add and get.

2. Singly Linked List  
   A linear structure where each node points to the next.  
   File: linkedlists/SinglyLinkedList.java  
   Supports inserting at the head and printing the list.

3. Stack  
   Implemented in two ways:
- Using array (File: stacks/StackArray.java)
- Using linked list (File: stacks/StackLinkedList.java)  
  Includes push, pop, and peek operations.

## Folder Structure

 StackArray.java  
 StackLinkedList.java

## How to Run

Use any Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.  
To run and test, add a main method to the class you want to try and execute it.

## Summary

Day 1 focused on implementing core data structures including dynamic arrays, singly linked lists, and stacks.
