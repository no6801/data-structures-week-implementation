# Data Structures Week Implementation (Java)

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures in Java, as part of a one-week training program.

## Day 1: Implemented Structures

1. Dynamic Array  
   A resizable array that grows automatically when it reaches capacity.  
   File: arrays/DynamicArray.java  
   Includes basic operations like add and get.

2. Singly Linked List  
   A linear structure where each node points to the next.  
   File: linkedlists/SinglyLinkedList.java  
   Supports inserting at the head and printing the list.

3. Stack  
   Implemented in two ways:
- Using array (File: stacks/StackArray.java)
- Using linked list (File: stacks/StackLinkedList.java)  
  Includes push, pop, and peek operations.

## Folder Structure

## How to Run

Use any Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.  
To run and test, add a main method to the class you want to try and execute it.

## Summary

Day 1 focused on implementing core data structures including dynamic arrays, singly linked lists, and stacks.




## Day 2: Implemented Structures

1. **Queue (Array-based)**  
   - File: `queues/QueueArray.java`  
   - Description: Implements a circular array-based queue with enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty methods.

2. **Queue (Linked list-based)**  
   - File: `queues/QueueLinkedList.java`  
   - Description: Implements a queue using singly linked nodes, supporting enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.

3. **Doubly Linked List**  
   - File: `linkedlists/DoublyLinkedList.java`  
   - Description: A linked list where each node points to both the next and previous node. Supports insertion and bidirectional printing.

4. **Circular Linked List**  
   - File: `linkedlists/CircularLinkedList.java`  
   - Description: A linked list where the last node points back to the head. Supports insertion and circular traversal.
   - ## Day 3: Implemented Structures

1. **Binary Tree**  
   - File: `trees/BinaryTree.java`  
   - Description: Basic binary tree structure with recursive methods for Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversal.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
   - File: `trees/BinarySearchTree.java`  
   - Description: A BST implementation that supports insertion and recursive traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## Day 4: Implemented Structures

1. MinHeap – File: `heaps/MinHeap.java`
2. Hash Table – File: `hashtables/HashTable.java`

## Day 5: Graphs

- Implemented Graph using adjacency list (`graphs/Graph.java`)
- Implemented BFS and DFS traversal (`graphs/GraphTraversal.java`)
